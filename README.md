# Paradigm 

[![Hits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshartlordyt%2FParadigm&count_bg=%233D81C8&title_bg=%23555555&icon=jsdelivr.svg&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=Daily+Visits+%7C+All+Time+Visits&edge_flat=false)](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com)  

Let's see where the flow takes us.

Paradigm is an upcomming site that will have a great selecton of games, and be fully future-proof. It will also not violate the terms of service of web IDE's like Replit and Glitch.  It will also host it's own games unlike it's predecessor, Noknok Games.

## The Future of NokNok

Noknok is currently my most popular unblocked games site, but it is currently poorly maintained. While Noknok was a great way for me to learn HTML, it has broken games, outdated pages that haven't been updated in months, rarely gets updated, and most importantly, steals games and does not self-host them. Noknok will still stay up even after Paradigm gets into a release-worthy state, but as a public archive. I will also no longer make links for Noknok unless it stays popular. Noknok will also recive one last update removing all broken games and unnecessary features. 

## Deploy 

Paradigm will have no-risk deploying on the following sites as it hosts no proxies or other things that would violate their TOS. Currently I don't recomend deploying unless you want to toy around with the code,  it as the site is very incomplete.

### Active Links

Currently, the only active unblocked link is https://shelbye12.github.io/Paradigm/, but it may be outdated. This section will be updated when the site is fully released.
 
## Site Plans

Honestly I don't know where that particular about:blank script came from, it's seemingly everywhere and I don't think it's Echo's.
